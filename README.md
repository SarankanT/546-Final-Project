# MSCI 546 - Final Project 
By: Hassan Rawasia, Kanishk Dutta, Kesojan Premakumar, Sarankan Thirunavukkarasu

## Introduction
On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. - Excerpt from Kaggle).

## Problem Statement
By analyzing the Titanic dataset, we seek to uncover the relationship between socioeconomic status and survival rates among passengers. This investigation will provide insights into the impact of social hierarchy on survival likelihood during one of the most well-documented maritime disasters in history.

## Data
For this project we used the ["Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster"](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data) dataset found on Kaggle. 
We analyzed 5 features from the dataset to configure the binary classification model:
- Ticket Class
- Sex
- Age
- Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic	
- Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

## Models & Neural Network
The .ipynb file includes six models as outlined in the MSCI 546 Final Project instructions. 
The 6 models are:
- Decision Tree Classifier (Baseline Model)
- Boosted Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- K Nearest Neighbour Classifier
- Logistic Regression
- Neural Network
